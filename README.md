# JLCE - Jupyter-Lite Custom Environment

## Run JLCE locally
```shell
python -m http.server
```

## Add Notebooks
Add any custom .ipynb files into `files` directory. These are automatically copied into the JL environment.

## Deploy
Deploy this repo to any webserver. Simply copy all files and open the URL. The server requires just HTTP support as there is no server-side python.

## Example
I have deployed this repo on Netlify here. https://splendid-choux-acd346.netlify.app/
